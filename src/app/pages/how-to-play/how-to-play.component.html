<h2>The Bibs</h2><p>Fight for the overall, sprint, relay, and distance world cup leader bibs by selecting the best athletes every week!</p><p>Races fit into the categories you'd expect them to. Will you target one of the lesser bibs, or sacrifice a chance at them for overall glory?</p><h2>Sidebets</h2><p>Sidebets are fun questions with yet-to-be-determined answers that let you earn extra points toward overall victory. Select an answer each week for a chance to win an extra handful of points-- over the season, these could prove critical!</p><h2>Team Selection</h2><p>One account is allowed per participant.</p><p>Congratulations, you have 100 000 fantasy dollars! You may use this money to buy athletes for your fantasy team.</p><p>Each athlete’s cost will change throughout the season. Your team will be kept from one weekend to the next. However, if the total value of your team becomes higher than the $100 000 budget, athletes will be removed, starting with the cheapest, from your team until it fits the budget. When you sell an athlete, you will receive the athlete’s current price.</p><p>Team selection closes before the first race of a regular weekend, and before each race of the tours. Trading will close as close as possible to that first race, but assume that it will be closed up to an hour prior.</p><p>A mildly detailed calendar of when team selection opens &amp; closes is included <a href="/events">on the events page</a>. FIS's World Cup calendar can be found <a href="https://assets.fis-ski.com/image/upload/v1668178015/fis-prod/assets/WC_Calendar_CC_2022-23_Nov2022.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, with a full list of competitions (including many not included not in this game) <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/calendar-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Not all athletes will compete in all races even in a given weekend-- choose wisely! It is up to you to select athletes that will be competing.</p><h2>Scoring</h2><p>In layman's terms, points for most races are awarded to the 50 top ranked in each race. The winner receives 100p and the skier in 50th position will receive 1 p. However, there are some exceptions for certain events. Please see details below.</p><p>The full scoring rules are outlined below:</p><ul><li>In general, points for each athlete in individual races are equivalent to World Cup Points as <a href="https://assets.fis-ski.com/image/upload/v1667297513/fis-prod/assets/World_Cup_Rules_Cross-Country_2022-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">outlined by FIS</a>. The exception is World Cup bonus points, including bonus points from mass start races, end of tour races, and sprint qualifiers, which will not be counted</li><li>For relays and team sprints, instead of individual athletes, you buy national teams, for example RUSSIA I, SWEDEN II, etc. The points a team receives are equal to the number of Nations Cup points their team scores in the race. No individual points are awarded for relays and team sprints. Please note that the first team from each country will be numbered as number I, in contrast to FIS where a team is not numbered if the country only starts one team. For example if FIS calls a team LATVIA, it will be named LATVIA I on Fantasy XC. Numbered teams (RUSSIA I, SWEDEN II, etc.) will have the same name on FIS and Fantasy XC.</li><li>The top 50 finishers from each tour will be awarded points in accordance with the FIS rules. This compensates for the fact that each individual stage is scored out of half as many points as a regular World Cup race.</li><li>For some events during the season, such as the tours and the World Championships, athlete selection will be allowed on a per-race basis.</li><li>Points will be updated each day that there is a race.</li><li>You can always leave and rejoin leagues; your score within the league is the same as your total score in the overall competition, no matter when you join.</li><li>The result list for a race is finalized 24 hours after the list was initially published, and no changes will be made to the results of the race after that point.</li></ul>
